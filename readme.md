# Organize the messy folder structure created by Apple's old iPhoto albums

## Technologies
- C++

## Description

The goal of this app is pretty simple. I'm trying to organize the albums of my computer, but everything htat I've previously uploaded to iPhoto is in a really unorganized file within a folder within another folder within another folder structure. It's really confusing and a hassle to organize.

Solution: Create a simple program that looks through each of these folders and creates a new folder of only the photos.

## Design Questions:
- Do I want to keep both the original and the new folder?
- What way do I want to sort the folders?
- What data structure to use? 
	- Recursion? 
	- Do I need to even make it that complex?
